### OpenSPP is a scalable, integrated and digital social protection information system.

OpenSPP is an open-source project that aims to streamline the management of social protection programs.
It can be used on its own or in conjunction with other services.

OpenSPP is based on an open-source ERP called [Odoo](https://odoo.com/documentation/15.0/). It allows
the project to take advantage of a vast ecosystem of existing integrations and modules.

OpenSPP is currently in development, and evolving rapidly as a result of our users' comments.
