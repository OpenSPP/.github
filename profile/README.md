# OpenSPP - Open Source Social Protection Platform

[Website](https://openspp.org) | [Documentation](https://docs.openspp.org/#)

Welcome to the OpenSPP project! OpenSPP is an open source digital social protection information system that aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of social protection systems in low and middle-income countries.

## Technical Overview

OpenSPP is an open source integrated and digital social protection information system based on an ERP called Odoo. We leverage other Digital Public Goods (DPGs) whenever possible to offer a comprehensive and integrated solution.

The system is built on a modular architecture, allowing organizations to customize and extend the platform to meet their specific needs and requirements. It is also designed to be scalable, adaptable, and interoperable, making it easy to integrate with other systems and platforms.

Some of the key technical features of OpenSPP include:

- Registration: Allows individuals and groups to register for social protection programs, capturing necessary information and documentation.
- Registry of individuals and groups: Maintains a comprehensive database of individuals and groups registered for programs.
- Change requests: Allows individuals and groups to request changes to their registration or program participation, such as updates to personal information or changes in eligibility.
- Assessment of eligibility: Automates the assessment of eligibility for social protection programs, using rules and criteria set by the organization.
- Program and cycle management: Manages the lifecycle of social protection programs, including the planning, implementation, and evaluation of programs.
- Cash transfer: Enables the distribution of cash payments to individuals and groups through various channels, including mobile money or e-wallets.
- In-kind distribution: Manages the distribution of in-kind assistance, such as food or other necessities.
- Reporting and analytics: Provides real-time data and insights on program performance and impact.
